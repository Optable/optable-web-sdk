    <h1>Example index.html importing a locally built <code>main.js</code></h1>
    The <code>index.html</code> you are rendering is importing a locally build <code>main.js</code> (using webpack).
    <br />
    <br />
    The <code>main.js</code> file imports Optable's <a href="https://github.com/Optable/optable-web-sdk">web-sdk</a> and makes
    example API calls to the configured DCN. The SDK was installed using NPM.
    <br />
    <br />
    To change the compiled <code>main.js</code>, edit the file <code>demos/npm/src/identifyAndTargeting.js</code>.
    <br />
    Make sure to configure the SDK according to your DCN's host and use the slug of the site you created in the DCN.
    <br />
    Then build again using webpack from the folder demos/npm:
    <pre>
      npm run build
    </pre>
    Finally, refresh this page (or open the generated <code>index.html</code> file located in <code>demos/npm/dist/index.html</code>).
    <br />
    <br />
    Each render will execute the generated code located in <code>demos/npm/dist/main.js</code> and output logs in the web console.
